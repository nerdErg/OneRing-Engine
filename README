One Ring - Scripting Rules Engine

One Ring isn't like other "Rules Engines", it's meant to be used as a web service for multiple applications
to gain access to scripted processing of arbitrary parameters.

This is the rule engine part of One Ring ( http://nerderg.com/One+Ring https://github.com/pmcneil/One-Ring )
split out to enable integrated rule testing in IDEs using junit or a groovy script.
